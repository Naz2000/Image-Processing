# Image-Processing
This project aims to conduct a study of some of the existing methods for counting Lymphocytes (Lymphocytes are one of several different types of white blood cells) in biomedical images, and using image processing algorithms such as:

Thresholding

Erosion Operation

Dilation Operation

Edge Detection

The number of Lymphocytes increase when the body confront with a disease therefore counting the number of Lymphocytes help to obtain useful information about the disease.
